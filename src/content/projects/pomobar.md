**_The Minimalist Pomodoro Timer for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)._**

Boost your productivity and maintain focus without ever leaving your notes. PomoBar is a sleek, unobtrusive Pomodoro timer that lives in your Obsidian status bar, with optional audio notifications to keep you on track. Seamlessly integrate the Pomodoro Technique into your workflow with visual and audible cues.

## Why Choose PomoBar?

- 🧘 **Stay Focused, Not Distracted:** PomoBar lives in your status bar, providing a constant but subtle reminder of your work session without cluttering your workspace.
- 🔊 **Optional Audio Notifications:** Get gentle sound alerts when timers complete—choose from default sounds or use your own custom audio files.
- 🖱️ **Intuitive & Quick Controls:** Manage your timers with simple clicks—no need to open new windows or type commands.
- 🔄 **Automated Flow:** Optional auto-progression automatically starts the next timer in your Pomodoro cycle, or pause after each session for manual control.
- ⚙️ **Fully Customizable:** Adjust timer durations, enable/disable sounds and auto-progression, and personalize your Pomodoro experience to fit your workflow perfectly.

## How It Works

The timer appears in your status bar. Here’s how to use it:

- **Left-click:** Start or pause the timer.
- **Middle-click:** Instantly cycle between work, short break, and long break timers.
- **Right-click:** Reset the current timer (when paused).
