I took time off work that morning to be home for a house inspection. Not the fun kind of time off where you do something you've been looking forward to, but the necessary kind where you're managing adult responsibilities that only happen during work hours.

The inspection revealed problems I wasn't expecting. Nothing catastrophic, but enough new issues to shift my mental budget calculations—like the bedroom window needing new hardware, or potentially an entire unit replacement. By the time I got to work, I was in that particular flavor of bad mood where everything feels slightly harder than it should be.

Then my phone rang. A resident had called City Hall asking specifically to speak with me. They left only a callback number.

My brain immediately went to complaint mode. Of course someone was calling with another problem. That's how these days go, right? One thing goes wrong and suddenly everything piles on. I picked up the phone to call back, bracing for whatever issue was about to land on my desk.

"I just wanted to call and thank you."

Wait, what?

## The Small Gesture That Landed

The resident explained that they'd reported an issue a few weeks ago—specifically about recurring backyard flooding involving a utility easement. They'd been worried it would just disappear into the void of municipal bureaucracy. But I'd responded, explained what we were doing about it, and kept them updated on the timeline.

They called specifically to tell me they felt better knowing someone was actually working on their problem. They weren't calling because it was fixed. They weren't even calling because significant progress had been made. They called because they felt heard.

That phone call completely shifted my day. Not because it solved any of my morning's problems, but because it reminded me to be grateful for work that actually connects with people. It's easy to forget that when you're stuck in administrative tasks and project management. But moments like this pull you back to why municipal work matters in the first place.

It was a powerful reminder that connection doesn't require a formal title or a paycheck. That gratitude can show up in the places you least expect it. But what happens when you actually seek out those positive interactions? Do they feel less valuable simply because you were already anticipating them?

## Anticipating Connection, Still Finding Surprise

A few weeks ago, I was volunteering as a driver for [Meals-on-Wheels](https://www.mealsonwheelsamerica.org/), doing my usual route. I always look forward to these deliveries because the people are genuinely the kindest you'll meet. I knew the interactions would be positive.

I handed over the meal to one of my regulars and was starting to turn away when they stopped me.

"What's your name?"

That was it. They just wanted to know about me. Such a simple question, but I wasn't expecting it at all. Even when you're anticipating a good interaction, there are these small moments that catch you off guard. They didn't just want their meal. They wanted to know who I was.

I'm grateful for moments like that. They remind me that volunteering isn't just about delivering meals or checking boxes. It's about the brief connections you make with people who genuinely see you as more than just the person at the door.

It's funny how that works. Sometimes you brace yourself for the worst and get surprised by kindness. Other times you're already expecting good and still get blown away by the smallest gestures. Both deserve equal appreciation.

## Recognizing What Actually Counts

We tend to only count the big wins. The completed projects. The major milestones. The things that make good headlines or look impressive on a resume.

But I'm learning to be more grateful for the other stuff. The phone call that makes someone's day better. The simple act of asking someone's name because you genuinely want to know. Following through on something small when it would've been easy to let it slide.

These moments don't show up in project completion reports. They don't get quantified anywhere. But they're often what people remember and what actually makes the work meaningful.

The resident who called took time out of their day to express gratitude for something I'd honestly forgotten about. The person receiving their meal delivery didn't just accept their food and close the door. They paused to make a human connection.

I'm grateful they did. Those small acknowledgments matter more than formal recognition ever could.

## Landing When You Need It

The resident who called didn't know they were pulling me out of a bad mood. They didn't know I'd been having a rough morning. They just wanted to express their gratitude for something that probably took me fifteen minutes to handle weeks ago.

The person asking my name at their doorstep didn't know that such a simple question would stick with me. They just wanted to know who was bringing them their meal so they could thank them properly.

I'm grateful for both of those moments. They landed exactly when I needed them, even though nobody planned it that way.

Sometimes it's the unexpected kindness that catches you off guard. Sometimes it's the simple gesture when you're already expecting good. Both remind you that the human element matters.

And maybe that's what gratitude really looks like. Not waiting for the big wins to celebrate, but recognizing the everyday moments that make the work worth doing.
