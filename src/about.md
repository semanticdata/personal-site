# About me

Hello! I’m Miguel Pimentel—a bridge between hard hats and hard drives. By day, I’m an Engineering Project Manager in Minnesota, focused on public infrastructure. By night, I’m a self-taught hobby developer and lifelong learner exploring how technology and better systems can solve real-world problems.

Born in the Dominican Republic, I document my professional journey, development projects, and insatiable appetite for learning right here.

## Chronic Curiosity

My diverse background isn't accidental; it’s driven by an insatiable curiosity. It leads me to explore a wide range of interests and projects. Over the years, this has led me to delve into projects like:

… designing bike trails and residential roads in AutoCAD Civil 3D.  
… creating my own Browser Extensions.  
… teaching English as a Second Language.  
… learning web development and computer programming.  
… getting licensed as a Firefighter.  
… getting certified as Emergency Medical Technician.  
… inspecting public road construction projects.  
… working in a construction materials laboratory.

In my free time, I'm drawn to even more topics, such as public infrastructure, digital gardening, materials science, game development, and personal knowledge management.

## The Path to Project Management

I currently serve as an Engineering Project Manager for the City of Crystal, overseeing the delivery of critical public infrastructure. My role is focused on managing complexity: I handle the full lifecycle of projects, from initial contract specification and cost estimation to final construction inspection and compliance. This requires constant coordination between private agencies, public entities (like Joint Water Commissions), and citizens, often relying heavily on advanced GIS and CAD systems to bridge technical gaps.

My journey started over 10 years ago as a Civil Engineering Technician in the Dominican Republic. While attending INTEC, personal circumstances prevented me from completing my civil engineering degree. This experience taught me a profound lesson: **learning doesn't stop when you leave school.** My career became a testament to practical, self-directed mastery, giving me unique experience not only in public works but also in technology, electrical, rail, and bus-related projects.

## Guided by Service and Rhythm

My dedication to public infrastructure and emergency services (including past roles as a volunteer/on-call Firefighter) is deeply rooted in a family tradition of serving the public. I come from a family defined by this commitment: my grandfather was an honorary firefighter in our hometown, my father managed public infrastructure (roads, water, and sanitation systems), and my mother served the public health system as a nurse. This collective legacy guides my commitment to creating practical, tangible improvements in my community.

When I step away from projects, I seek grounding and rhythm. Music is my most reliable productivity driver and source of relaxation. I also enjoy cooking with my wife and taking photographs.

## What You'll Find Here

This website serves as my public notebook and workshop—a place to connect the dots between engineering management and digital creation. If you stick around, you'll find content covering:

- **Infrastructure Management:** Insights into successful public works projects, contract strategies, and practical applications of CAD/GIS systems.
- **Self-Taught Tech:** Documentation of my current coding projects, web development tutorials, and explorations into better systems for organizing knowledge.
- **Process Improvement:** How the engineering and project management mindset applies to learning new skills, optimizing workflows, and maximizing personal productivity.
