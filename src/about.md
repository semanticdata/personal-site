# About me

Hello, my name is Miguel Pimentel. I am an engineering project manager and self-taught hobby developer born in the Dominican Republic, and currently living in Minnesota, US.
Chronic Curiosity

I have an insatiable curiosity that leads me to explore a wide range of interests and projects. Some of the things I've delved into include:

    … designing bike trails and residential roads in AutoCAD Civil 3D.
    … creating my own Browser Extensions.
    … teaching English as a Second Language.
    … learning web development and computer programming.
    … getting licensed as a Firefighter.
    … getting certified as Emergency Medical Technician.
    … inspecting public road construction projects.
    … working in a construction materials laboratory.

In my free time, I'm drawn to even more topics, such as public infrastructure, digital gardening, materials science, game development, and personal knowledge management.
Professional Experience

As an Engineering Project Manager for the City of Crystal. Some of my duties include preparing detailed plans, specifications, solicitations, proposals for bids, and cost estimates; managing contracts from bid solicitation through project completion; and inspecting ongoing and completed construction for compliance with those specifications.

I also maintain accurate project records, review as-built plans, and oversee right-of-way management and permitting. My role involves working closely with various private and public agencies, utilizing GIS and CAD systems, and assisting with Joint Water Commission and Watershed District functions.
Career Journey

With over 10 years of experience in construction, I have amassed several unique projects and experiences that cover many different fields. It all started when I got my first job as a Civil Engineering Technician for a contracting company near my university. I was at the time attending INTEC while pursuing a bachelor's in civil engineering. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish my college education due to personal reasons.

Nevertheless, today I thrive having experience in not only public infrastructure, but technology, electrical, rail, and bus related projects as well. In the past, you could also find me working as a volunteer/on-call Firefighter for the City of Bloomington.
