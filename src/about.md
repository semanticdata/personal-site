# About me

I’m Miguel Pimentel. I live in Minnesota and work as an Engineering Project Manager for the City of Crystal. While I spend my days managing the construction and maintenance of public infrastructure, I use this site to document my work in software development and data analysis.

## Professional Background

My daily focus is the delivery of municipal projects. This includes everything from the design of street resurfacing plans to the management of large-scale road and utility contracts. My role requires a balance of technical oversight and coordination. I handle contract specifications, cost estimation, and final construction inspections while ensuring compliance between private agencies and public entities.

I began this journey over twelve years ago as a Civil Engineering Technician in the Dominican Republic. I eventually moved into project management, where I now rely on GIS and CAD systems to manage the lifecycle of physical infrastructure.

## The Self-Directed Path

My approach to expertise is non-traditional. While studying at INTEC, I found that I lacked the drive for traditional academics and eventually moved away from a formal degree. However, as I gained experience in the field, I discovered a profound motivation for learning that school had not sparked.

This shift defined my career. I have spent the last decade in a process of self-directed mastery. I taught myself how to build software and use data analysis to solve specific problems. I believe that an engineer’s value is found in the ability to understand a system and improve it, regardless of whether that system is built of concrete or code.

## Areas of Experience

My background is a mix of technical precision and public service:

- **Public Infrastructure:** Managing municipal projects, designing residential road plans in AutoCAD Civil 3D, and overseeing construction site inspections.
- **Digital Tools:** Building Obsidian plugins and Firefox extensions to optimize my personal workflow.
- **Data Analysis:** Developing Python-based prototypes to help stakeholders explore and understand public data, such as our Adopt-a-Drain program.
- **Public Safety:** A past chapter as a licensed Firefighter and EMT, which provided early experience in managing systems under pressure.

## A Legacy of Service

My interest in public works is rooted in a family tradition of serving the community. My father managed municipal water and road systems, my mother was a nurse, and my grandfather was a firefighter. This legacy guides my commitment to the "boring" but essential infrastructure that keeps a city running. I am driven by the desire to create tangible, reliable improvements in the physical and digital systems we all use.

## What You'll Find Here

This website is my public notebook. It is a place to connect the dots between engineering management and digital creation. I share content covering:

- **Infrastructure Management:** Insights into public works, contract strategies, and CAD/GIS applications.
- **Software and Automation:** Documentation of my coding projects, technical tutorials, and personal knowledge management.
- **Process Improvement:** Applying an engineering mindset to learning new skills and optimizing workflows.

When I’m away from the terminal or a project site, I am usually cooking with my wife, [taking photographs](https://database.some.pics/), or finding the right rhythm for a new playlist.
