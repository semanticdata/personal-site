      I'm Miguel Pimentel. I live in Minnesota and work as an Engineering Project Manager for the City of Crystal. While I spend my days managing construction and maintenance of public infrastructure, I use this site to document my work in software development and data analysis.

    <h2 class="serif title-md">Professional Background</h2>
    <p class="lead serif text-alt" style="margin-bottom: var(--s2);">
      My daily focus is on delivery of municipal projects. This includes everything from design of street resurfacing plans to management of large-scale road and utility contracts. My role requires a balance of technical oversight and coordination. I handle contract specifications, cost estimation, and final construction inspections while ensuring compliance between private agencies and public entities.

    <p>
      I began this journey over twelve years ago as a Civil Engineering Technician in the Dominican Republic. I eventually moved into project management, where I now rely on GIS and CAD systems to manage the lifecycle of physical infrastructure.

    <h2 class="serif title-md">The Self-Directed Path</h2>
    <p class="lead serif text-alt" style="margin-bottom: var(--s2);">
      My approach to expertise is non-traditional. While studying at INTEC, I found that I lacked a drive for traditional academics and eventually moved away from a formal degree. However, as I gained experience in the field, I discovered a profound motivation for learning that school had not sparked.

    <p>
      This shift defined my career. I have spent the last decade in a process of self-directed mastery. I taught myself how to build software and use data analysis to solve specific problems. I believe that an engineer's value is found in the ability to understand a system and improve it, regardless of whether that system is built of concrete or code.

    <h2 class="serif title-md">A Legacy of Service</h2>
    <p class="lead serif text-alt" style="margin-bottom: var(--s2);">
      My interest in public works is rooted in a family tradition of serving the community. My father managed municipal water and road systems, my mother was a nurse, and my grandfather was a firefighter. This legacy guides my commitment to "boring" but essential infrastructure that keeps a city running. I am driven by a desire to create tangible, reliable improvements in physical and digital systems we all use.

      This website is my public notebook. It is a place to connect the dots between engineering management and digital creation. I share content covering:

      When I'm away from the terminal or a project site, I am usually cooking with my wife, taking photographs, or finding the right rhythm for a new playlist.
