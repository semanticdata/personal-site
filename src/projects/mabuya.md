[Mabuya](https://mabuya.vercel.app/) is a lightweight [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) theme for creating fast, SEO-optimized blogs.  
Put your work front and center with Mabuya as the base of your project.

## ⓘ Background

While searching for themes, I stumbled upon [Tale](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola). Unfortunately, the last update was on December, 2021. Soon after, I decided to fork the project and add my own touches to it.

The name **Mabuya** comes from the [Mabuya hispaniolae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabuya_hispaniolae?useskin=vector), a possibly extinct[^1] species of skink endemic to the Dominican Republic, my home country.
