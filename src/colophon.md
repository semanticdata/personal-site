# Colophon

This website is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator, and hosted on Heztner/Vercel. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/semanticdata/personal-site). Most content is written in Markdown. Most templates are written in [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/).

In the past I've used Jekyll, Hugo, Zola, and Astro for previous versions of the site.
