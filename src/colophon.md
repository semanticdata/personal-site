# Colophon

This website is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The [source code](https://github.com/semanticdata/personal-site) is public on GitHub.

## Tech Stack

- Templating: [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
- Styling: Custom [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).
- Structure: Based on [11ty/eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) and inspired by [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/).

## History

This site has undergone several iterations. I have previously used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), and [Astro](https://astro.build/) for [previous versions](https://github.com/semanticdata/semanticdata.github.io). I moved to Eleventy for its flexibility and performance.

## Privacy and Analytics

I use [Umami](https://github.com/umami-software/umami) for privacy-focused web analytics. I self-host the instance on a [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) VPS along with other personal services. Umami does not collect personal data or use cookies, making it GDPR and PECR compliant by design.

## Features

- We use [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) to implement fluid typography across the site.
- We have an [RSS feed](/rss.xml), an [Atom feed](/atom.xml), and a [JSON feed](/feed.json) available.
- We are currently using [@zachleat/snow-fall](https://github.com/zachleat/snow-fall) for a seasonal effect. I wrote about [implementing it responsibly](/blog/2025-12-17-adding-snow-fall-with-is-land/) using `<is-land>`.
