# Colophon

> [!TLDR] TL;DR:
> This website is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator, and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/semanticdata/personal-site).

In the past I've used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), and [Astro](https://astro.build/) for [previous versions](https://github.com/semanticdata/semanticdata.github.io) of the site. The current version is based on [11ty/eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) and is highly inspired by [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/).

We use [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for most templates, [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) for styling, and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to author most content. Post images are collocated with their content.

We have an [RSS feed](/rss.xml), an [Atom feed](/atom.xml), and a [JSONfeed](/feed.json) available.

The analytics are powered by [Umami](https://github.com/umami-software/umami), an open-source, privacy-focused web analytics tool which I host together with some other services from a [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) VPS. Unlike many traditional analytics platforms, Umami does not collect or store personal data, avoiding the need for cookies, and is GDPR and PECR compliant.
