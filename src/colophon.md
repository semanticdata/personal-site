This website is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator, and hosted on Vercel. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/semanticdata/personal-site).

In the past I've used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), and [Astro](https://astro.build/) for [previous versions](https://github.com/semanticdata/semanticdata.github.io) of the site.

It is based on [11ty/eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog). We use [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for most templates, CSS for styling, and Markdown to author most content.
