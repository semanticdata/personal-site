> [!INFO] TL;DR:
> This website is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator, and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/semanticdata/personal-site).


In the past I've used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), and [Astro](https://astro.build/) for [previous versions](https://github.com/semanticdata/semanticdata.github.io) of the site. The current version is based on [11ty/eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog). We use [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for most templates, CSS for styling, and Markdown to author most content.

The analytics are powered by [Umami](https://github.com/umami-software/umami) which I host together with some other services from a [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) VPS.
